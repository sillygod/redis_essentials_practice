# the study for Redis Essentials

I learn and practice redis with book's example codes in python and keep notes in this repo.

## Environment

 - python 3.x
 - redis python binding
 
install it by `pip install redis`


## redis command 

[the doc](https://redis.io/commands) in redis official site has some example and usage for commands. I think that's only one good reference you can look up.

current progress 50/230
